            Keveisha, amid your disbelief, you're perfect. Though it is something I say everyday, I still don't think you'll ever truly understand how much you mean to me. I will admit, my initial attraction was based on your beauty and how effortlessly sexy you are. However, me falling head of Clark's is about way more than that. Baby, your energy is contagious. Your presence gives me peace. Your voice is like a soundtrack I never get tired of hearing. Your overall essence is captivating and I spend everyday hoping I'll have you forever. Therefore, I want you to be my Valentine, not because of some cliche, but because I look at each day as an opportunity to show you just how much I love you.
